The file w4_assignment contains a calculation of sentiment based on spacytextblobs calculation of polarity. \

The data itself is not attached and it may therefore be necessary to change the filepath depending on where you have located the data. The data can be found by the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/therohk/million-headlines\

I recommend skipping the actual calculation of polarity as it can take about 40 minutes. I have attached a subset from the sentiment_df.csv I used to calculate the polarity. The subset file is called subset_sentiment_df.csv and I recommend that you load it and use it for the calculations.}
