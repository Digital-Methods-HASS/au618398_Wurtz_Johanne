The project includes a tool for working with transcribed interviews. The project was made in connection with my exam in Cultural Data Science at Aarhus University 2020. 
The project is made on the basis of making work with qualitative data, here especially interviews, easier by combining a number of relevant functions for data organization in one program.

The program is made and runs in Python and uses th Pandas library. The program itself consists of the CDS-transcription-tool.ipynb program as well as dummy_text_1.csv and dummy_text_2.csv. The two dummy texts are for you to use the program before using it in a work context.

The program provides additional information about the various steps and installation requirements.

There is an MIT license associated with the program which can be found in the LICENSES file.
